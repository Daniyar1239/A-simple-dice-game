# A-simple-dice-game
## A simple three-player dice game written in C++

The user can specify the number of games to be played by three (or more if needed) players. Two dice are thrown, and the sum of two dice values is added to player's previous score if the sum is odd. If it is even, it won't be added to the total score. 

After the specified number of games, the winner will be the one with the highest score.
